# CURRENT_TASK — Exit-branch patching (faithful LuaJIT port), doc 17

## Status 2026-07-13 (latest) — 2.3c-1 M1 half-fusion LANDED (green, byte-identical)

Implemented the reviewed M1 contract end-to-end:

- **trace.zig arm.** `driveChain` now arms the failing skip trace's source-branch guard
  slot → the prime-side ramp's `ordinary_entry`
  (`armNativeLink(failed, exit_instr, sct, oe, .ordinary_guard)`), gated
  `tier == .native_only ∧ safe_to_arm ∧ materialization == .ordinary_header ∧
  sct.inputs.len == 0 ∧ isSourceBranchGuardExit(failed, exit_instr, proto)`. `failed` is
  now `*Trace` (mutable, `armNativeLink` needs it). New counter `native_source_link_arms`.
- **trace.zig `runLinkedBurst`.** Extracted the ping-pong burst body out of `driveChain`
  into a now-`pub` method so both `driveChain` and the dispatcher consumer enter it with
  an already-run ramp result. Verified it reads `sresult` ONLY via
  `fused_inner = if (sresult_fused) sresult else null` — with `sresult_fused == false`
  (M1 seed) the seed result is entirely unused, so passing the fused `result`
  (`completed == skip_local`) is byte-identical to the unarmed seed (`completed == 0`).
- **trace.zig `fusedSourceBranchLinkSlot`.** Provenance recognizer: returns `ct`'s
  source-branch guard slot if an armed record `{parent==ct, child==final}` exists whose
  slot is `isSourceBranchGuardExit` and `final.anchor == ct.anchor`; else null. Excludes
  the 2.3b-1 `.link_terminal` continuation→inner edge (its slot is a `.link` op, not a
  guard) and, once 2.3c-2 lands, the persistently-armed inner→continuation.
- **interp.zig fused-`.link` consumer.** Inserted after `local_done`, before guard-
  failure counting. Gated `ran_native ∧ final != ct ∧ result.exit_reason == .normal ∧
  result.exit_instr < final.instrs.len`; on provenance match: `native_source_link_fused`
  bump, `onSideExit(ct, skip_local = result.completed)`, two inert-hook asserts, then
  split — ramp `.link` → `runLinkedBurst(final, result, false, nt, .native_only,
  .ordinary_header, …)`; internal-guard deopt → `onSideExit(final, 0)` + resume at
  `ct.anchor.pc` (byte-identical to the unarmed `driveChain` seed's `{0, walk_pc}`).
  Fused prologue-fail (`exit_reason != .normal`, unreachable in practice — value-branch
  guards fire with types coherent) falls through to normal handling per the reviewed gate.
- **Verify.** `just test` green (incl. the 10-mode differential/keyframe goldens + two
  new `> 0` counter asserts in the Phase-2 nsieve chain test). 6 benchmarks
  tier-0==tier-1a==native byte-identical; nsieve `--emit-keyframe` tier-0==native
  byte-identical. Perf expected ~neutral on nsieve tiny clusters (consistent with
  2.3b-1) — value is completing native chain coverage + de-risking Increment 3, not a
  standalone speedup.

**NEXT:** commit (conventional, local only), then Increment 2.3c-2 (arm loop-done
inner→continuation — closes the native cycle; land only after 2.3c-0e disarm-on-unsafe
is proven load-bearing).

## Status 2026-07-13 — 2.3c fused-transition contract DESIGNED + review-clean

- **2.3c-1 re-scoped to M1 half-fusion (design only, not yet coded).** A codex
  gpt-5.6-sol pre-implementation review found the terse "arm skip→prime-side" scope
  *incoherent*: the prime-side is a `.link` **entry ramp** (no numeric-for back-edge),
  so arming `skip.guard` alone lands the fused run at the ramp's `.link` terminal with
  regs coherent at the **inner** PC while the dispatcher misreads it as an outer-header
  zero-exit → semantic **misresume**. Wrote `docs/design/17` §"Increment 2.3c —
  fused-transition contract" choosing **M1 (half-fusion)**: arm ONLY
  `skip.guard → prime_side.ordinary_entry`; decode the root's own count as
  `result.completed` (ramp commits 0 iterations → **no new NativeResult field**); add a
  dispatcher *fused top-level `.link` consumer* that replays `onSideExit(ct, skip_local)`
  + continues the burst via a `driveChain` seed of the already-run ramp result WITHOUT
  re-running the ramp. Rejected **M2** (full single-call skip→ramp→inner fusion) as
  needing the deferred P-F per-hop ledger nothing on the roadmap requires.
- **codex round-2 review of the written M1 design: confirmed + 1 BLOCKER + 1 SHOULD-FIX,
  both folded into the doc.** Confirmed: receipt decode (ramp never `inc rbx` between
  `ordinary_entry` and its `.link`), register coherence, inert-hook asserts, `onSideExit`
  ordering. BLOCKER: the fused-`.link` recognizer must discriminate on **P-E armed-edge
  provenance** (`parent==ct ∧ child==final ∧ slot_index` a source-branch guard) with a
  `exit_reason==.normal ∧ exit_instr<len` bounds gate — NOT the bare
  `final.instrs[exit_instr].op==.link` opcode, which OOBs on a fused prologue-fail
  (`exit_instr==maxInt`) and false-positives once 2.3c-2 persistently arms the
  inner→continuation slot (a directly-entered inner can return `final==continuation`,
  `final[exit_instr].op==.link`). SHOULD-FIX: the driveChain seed must consume a
  `current_link`-owned `.link` receipt at trace.zig:~1390, NOT initialize `fused_inner`
  from the ramp result (that field means the result already belongs to an inner root,
  resolved via `isInnerLoopRoot` → would panic/misclassify).
- **NEXT: implement 2.3c-1 M1** (task #55) now that the design is review-clean.

## Status 2026-07-12 (previous latest)

- **Increment 2.3c-0 (inert contracts + post-review blocker fixes): LANDED.** Six
  inert sub-steps a–f (commits `7523d1e` re-scope, `094ff89` 0b, `c295586` 0c,
  `131bc10` 0d, `bebbd48` 0e, `fd3c42e` 0f, `d276353` 0a), each byte-identical.
  Then a **codex gpt-5.6-sol contract review found 3 blockers, now all closed**
  (commit `e6b618c` fix + `5411105` test-strengthen):
  1. **Blocker 1 (broke correctness on a spilled carried home).** 0f's shared
     `deopt_exit` staged the dispatch holder in rax, but `flushSlot`'s spilled-
     carried-home `.mem` path scratches rax — clobbering the holder before the jump.
     Fix: stage the RESOLVED target in a new flush-immune `NativeResult.exit_target`
     memory field; `deopt_exit` ends `jmp qword [rdx+exit_target]`. Proven load-
     bearing by a negative control (revert tail to `jmp rax` → only the frameless
     carried-spill regression crashes).
  2. **Blocker 2 (reserved cell arm-addressable).** The exit_target fix let the
     reserved `slots[n]` "direct cell" be DELETED → `slots.len == instrs.len`, so
     `armNativeLink`'s `slot_index >= slots.len` bound rejects index n.
  3. **Blocker 3 (`final` dropped under driveChain's 8-cap).** Dispatcher `excl`
     buffer now orders `final` FIRST so driveChain's own `[8]` copy retains it.
  codex re-review: all closed, no new correctness blocker. `just test` green; 6
  benchmarks byte-identical tier-0/tier-1a/native. **NEXT: 2.3c-1** (task #55) — arm
  skip→prime-side ordinary source-branch guard (no cycle).

## Status 2026-07-12

- **Increment 1 (P-D, shared mcode arena): LANDED** — commit `a970da4`.
- **Increment 2.1 (P-A, frameless chain-entry ABI): LANDED** — commit `3f46d5e`.
  Frameless trampoline + frameless bodies; all exits pinned to `shared_exit`.
- **Increment 2.2 (P-B, chain-wide result contract): LANDED** — commit `1f39d8a`.
  Stable `Trace.id` + `NativeResult.final_trace_id` baked at every native exit +
  `traceById` dispatcher resolve/assert. No linking yet; every exit bakes its own
  `ct.id`, so `final == ct` and behaviour is byte-identical.
- **Increment 2.3a (indirect exit + link-slot table + P-E registry): LANDED** —
  commit `b8fc3fa` (+ hardening `286b145`). Indirect `jmp qword [&slot]` exit;
  per-trace heap-owned `slots: []usize` defaulting to `shared_exit`; inert P-E
  backlink registry. Byte-identical.
- **Increment 2.3b-0 (inert arming scaffolding): LANDED** — commits `9d16711`,
  `963bdbb`, `319da11`, `954ea89` (+ review `e658d07`). S3 cumulative-rbx prep,
  fail-closed `traceById`, `entry_rbx`→`local_completed`, `linked_entry` stub.
  Nothing armed; `final == ct`; byte-identical.
- **Increment 2.3b-1 (flip `.link` arming on): LANDED** — Step B (dispatcher routes
  through `final`) committed `66107a7`; Step A (driveChain persistent arming +
  unified fusion drain) is THIS commit. See the 2.3b-1 section below.
- **Increment 2.3c-0: LANDED** (see the latest-status block at the top).
- **Increment 2.3c-1 / 2.3c-2 : DESIGNED + PEER-REVIEWED + DECIDED** — see
  `docs/design/17-exit-branch-patching.md` (Done/Outstanding) and the plan file.

## What 2.2 changed (the chain-wide result contract, P-B)

Files: `src/irinterp.zig`, `src/trace.zig`, `src/nativegen.zig`, `src/interp.zig`.

- **`irinterp.zig`**: `pub const NO_TRACE_ID: u32 = maxInt(u32)` sentinel;
  `ExecResult` gains `final_trace_id: u32 = NO_TRACE_ID` (**defaulted** → the ~40
  tier-1a `ExecResult{…}` sites are untouched, zero churn).
- **`trace.zig`**: `Trace.id: u32` (stable, monotonic, never reused — the cache
  index is `swapRemove`'d so it can't be a baked constant); `TraceState.next_trace_id`
  bumped + assigned at finalize; `traceById(id)` resolver.
- **`nativegen.zig`**: `NativeResult.final_trace_id: u32`; `emitReturn` takes a
  `trace_id` param and bakes it via `movMemImm32(.rdx, @offsetOf(NativeResult,
  "final_trace_id"), trace_id)` before teardown/jump (rdx = `*NativeResult` at every
  exit); the 4 `lower` call sites pass `t.id`; `runWithLinkedLoopDone` inits and
  marshals the field.
- **`interp.zig`**: dispatcher resolves `final = traceById(result.final_trace_id)
  orelse ct` and `if (ran_native) assert(final == ct)` — validates the full baked-id
  round-trip while staying byte-identical (consumers still route through `ct`; 2.3
  switches them to `final`).

### Verification done for 2.2
- `just test` green (EXIT=0; Debug asserts active).
- nsieve 9: tier-0 == tier-1a == native byte-identical; `--jit-native` exit 0
  (assert `final == ct` passed for all native traces).
- Differential tier-0 vs native OK on: nsieve, nsieve-bit, fannkuch, mandelbrot,
  nbody, spectral-norm.

## What 2.1 changed (the frameless ABI move)

Files: `src/x64.zig`, `src/nativegen.zig`.

- **`x64.zig`**: added `jmpReg` (FF /4, indirect near jump through a GP register) +
  golden-byte test (`jmp rcx/rax/r15`).
- **`nativegen.zig`**:
  - `pub const SPILL_MAX: u32 = 512` — frameless spill ceiling (4 KiB). Even, so
    `SPILL_MAX*8` is 16-aligned → body `rsp % 16 == 8` (same invariant the
    self-framed prologue gave, which the hash-cell callout relies on).
  - `McodeArena.ensureTrampoline()` — emits the shared trampoline ONCE into a
    permanent (never-freed) arena slot; returns `{entry, shared_exit}` absolute
    addrs. Trampoline: `push rbx/rbp/r12/r13/r14/r15; sub rsp,SPILL_MAX*8;
    xor rbx,rbx; jmp rcx`. `shared_exit`: `add rsp,SPILL_MAX*8; pop …; ret`.
    C-ABI `fn(rdi=tags, rsi=payloads, rdx=*NativeResult, rcx=body_entry)`.
  - `CompiledTrace.trampoline_entry: ?usize` + `TrampolineFn` type; `run` dispatches
    through the trampoline for arena (production) pages, directly (`EntryFn`) for
    owned (test) pages.
  - `compileImpl`: when `arena != null`, bail if `alloc.spill_count > SPILL_MAX`,
    else `ensureTrampoline` and pass `shared_exit` into `lower`; sets
    `trampoline_entry` on the result.
  - `lower(…, shared_exit: ?usize)`: prologue push/sub guarded behind
    `shared_exit == null`; every exit now calls `emitReturn(a, frame, callee,
    shared_exit)` — self-framed teardown when null, `movabs rax,shared_exit;
    jmp rax` (absolute, direct) when set.
  - Test path (`compile`, `arena == null`) keeps the OLD self-framed ABI → ~60
    standalone-page tests untouched + built-in A/B of both ABIs.

Refinement vs the doc's final design: 2.1 uses a *direct* absolute jmp to
`shared_exit` at each exit (no per-trace slot table). 2.3 replaces it with the
indirect `jmp [slot]` handoff (slot default = `shared_exit`) when link population
lands. Behaviourally identical while no slot is armed.

### Verification done for 2.1
- `just test` green (EXIT=0).
- nsieve 9: tier-0 == tier-1a == native byte-identical.
- 5 native traces compile+run frameless (`--dump-native`).
- Differential tier-0 vs native OK on: nsieve, nsieve-bit, fannkuch, mandelbrot,
  nbody, spectral-norm, sieve_int, **field_hash** (the resolveHashCell callout —
  most rsp-alignment-sensitive), array3d, grid_matmul.
- `just bench --filter nsieve --reps 5`: jit ms flat (93.3→91.5 nsieve;
  52.5→53.3 nsieve-bit; within noise). ABI move is perf-neutral (expected — no
  linking yet, just one extra indirect jmp per trace entry/exit).

## What 2.3a changed (indirect exit + slot table + P-E registry, byte-identical)

Files: `src/x64.zig`, `src/nativegen.zig`, `src/trace.zig`.

- **`x64.zig`**: added `jmpMem(base, disp)` (FF /4 memory form, indirect near jump
  through `[base+disp]`) + golden-byte tests (`FF 20`, `FF 60 08`, `41 FF 20`).
- **`nativegen.zig`**: `CompiledTrace` gains `slots: []usize` (owned, one per IR
  instruction index, default-filled `shared_exit`) + a `gpa` handle for `deinit`.
  `emitReturn` takes `slot_addr: ?usize` — when set (frameless + chainable exit) it
  emits `movabs rax, &slot; jmp qword [rax]`; `null` (deopt_exit/prologue_fail) keeps
  the direct `movabs rax, shared_exit; jmp rax`. `compileImpl` allocs `slots` *before*
  `lower` (stable imm64), frees on every failure path; `slotAddr(slots, i)` helper.
- **`trace.zig`**: `NativeLink{parent, slot_index, child}` + `TraceState.armed_links`
  list; `armNativeLink` (records dependency, supersedes same-slot record, then writes
  slot); `resetLinksTouching(t)` (child-retire → reset parent slots to `shared_exit`;
  parent-retire → drop record; slot addr re-derived from live parent, never cached);
  `removeTrace` calls it *before* `destroy`. Focused unit test pins both directions +
  re-arm supersede + OOB/non-compiled no-ops.

Nothing arms a slot yet → `armed_links` always empty, every exit still resolves to
its own `ct.id`, so `final == ct` holds and output is byte-identical.

### Verification done for 2.3a
- `just test` green (EXIT=0; Debug asserts + P-E registry unit test).
- nsieve 9: tier-0 == tier-1a == native byte-identical.
- Differential tier-0 vs native OK on: nsieve, nsieve-bit, fannkuch, mandelbrot,
  nbody, spectral-norm.
- `just bench --filter nsieve --reps 5`: jit ms flat (nsieve 94.2 vs 2.1's 91.5;
  nsieve-bit 53.8 vs 53.3; within noise — one extra load per exit is perf-neutral).

## 2.3a foundation review (two independent models) — DONE, hardening landed

Reviewed the `b8fc3fa` foundation with codex gpt-5.6-sol + a fable
technical-architect pass (Bart's call: review the foundation now, not just at the
end). Both returned **"approve with changes"** and converged: byte-identical holds,
S2 reset ordering correct both directions, slot addressing sound, and the flat
identity-keyed registry is genuinely *better* than the plan's pointer-map (which
would dangle its cached `*usize` on parent-retire).

**Hardening landed as a follow-up commit (still inert / byte-identical):**
- **BUG-1 (real latent OOM-only UAF, mine):** `armNativeLink` re-arm did
  `swapRemove(old)` then `try append(new)`; a failed append stranded the slot armed
  but untracked → S2 UAF on the old child's retire. Fixed: mutate the record in
  place on supersede (no allocation on the re-arm path). Doc comment corrected.
- `armNativeLink` now returns `bool` (armed vs no-op) for P-F accounting; pinned
  "only writer of `slots[i]`" invariant; unit test updated.
- doc 17: recorded the `rdi`/`rsi` liveness contract (P-A) and the
  slot-index-vs-exit-kind collision open question (P-C, blocks 2.3c).

**Bart's decisions from the review:**
- `armNativeLink` **keeps** the explicit `target` param + gets a Debug
  bounds-assert (`target` within `child`'s page). Deferred to 2.3b because the
  assert reads `child.page` → needs real compiled children (= fable's real
  retire-then-reuse test, item 6).
- **Pull S3 forward into 2.3b:** fix the chain-safe result contract (child
  prologue-fail must carry cumulative `rbx` + a distinct reason, never
  `completed=0`) BEFORE arming any slot, so the first arm is unconditionally
  chain-safe. codex flagged this as a hard prerequisite to the first real arm.

## NEXT: Increment 2.3b — arm `.link`-terminal handoffs (now incl. S3)

Slot table + P-E registry exist but nothing arms a slot. 2.3b makes `driveChain`
store a child's frameless body entry into the parent's slot for the **single-contract
`.link` terminal only** (avoids S1 loop-done dual materialization):
- **S3 result contract FIRST (pulled forward):** split `prologue_fail` so a child
  whose entry guard fails *after* the parent committed writes cumulative `rbx` +
  `final_trace_id=child` + a distinct reason, never `exit_instr=-1`/`completed=0`.
- **Bounds-assert + BUG-2:** add the Debug `target`-within-`child`-page assert in
  `armNativeLink` and the missing-trampoline assert in `resetLinksTouching`; add a
  real retire-then-reuse lifetime test (arm, force `removeTrace`, assert parent slot
  reset before the arena slot can be reused).
- **Eligibility (P-G):** child `.compiled`, `inputs.len == 0`, exit kind `.link`.
- **Arming point (P-F):** inside `driveChain` *after* the existing per-hop
  `onSideExit`/counters run, so every accounting side effect still happens; then
  `armNativeLink(&parent, E, child, child.page.code.ptr)` (now returns bool).
- **Safepoint blackout:** do NOT arm when `suspend_ctl`/replay-line/exec-log active.
- **Dispatcher (P-B payoff):** DROP `assert(final == ct)`; route consumers through
  `final` not `ct` — `last_exit_instr`, guard-fail counting
  (`final.instrs[exit_instr]`), `onSideExit(final,…)`, `maybeArmContinuation`,
  productive-branch counting, source-branch discrimination (interp.zig ~2586–2807).
Then 2.3c (ordinary guards + loop-done, S1; slot-identity collision decision), 2.3d
(P-E lane-widen end-to-end + peer-review full diff). Increment 3 = full
`lj_asm_patchexit` port (guard-jump rel32 patching, no runtime re-entry).

## 2.3b CONTRACT REVIEW (codex gpt-5.6-sol) — planned scope is WRONG, re-plan pending

Ran the arming contract past codex before coding the dispatcher rewire. Verdict:
**"do NOT implement 2.3b as 'arm the slot, drop `final==ct`, route everything
through `final`'."** Two substantive findings the plan missed:

- **BLOCKER — the `.link` terminal is NOT single-contract on the child side.**
  The L→I hop (a `.link` continuation reaching its terminal, handing off to the
  inner-loop root `I`) is run today via `int_native.runLinkedLoopDone(regs)`, which
  sets `NativeResult.linked_loop_done = 1`; `I`'s inner loop-done guard READS that
  flag (nativegen ~4213) to pick linked-completion materialization vs ordinary
  deopt. A bare armed `jmp I.page.code.ptr` does **not** set the flag → `I` takes
  ordinary `deopt_exit`, never commits its final iteration → wrong state. So arming
  `.link`→inner drags in the S1 mode-propagation that was supposed to be deferred to
  2.3c. Fix needs one of: (a) a second entry point on `I` (`linked_entry`) that
  presets the flag then falls into the body — armed slot targets that; (b) a per-arm
  stub that sets the flag then jumps; (c) enter armed parents with the flag already
  set. (a) is cleanest (compile-time, no runtime thunk, `I` codegen unchanged).
- **DETERMINISM TRAP — "route consumers through `final`" is unsafe as-is.** Exit
  IDENTITY (`exit_instr`, guard lookup, exit PC, resume PC) must use `final`. But
  the recording-STEERING accounting (`onSideExit`, `maybeArmContinuation`,
  `countProductiveBranchExit`) must reproduce driveChain's *logical* per-hop events,
  which are specific (validate loop-done → `onSideExit(I, max(local,1))` → +1
  enclosing progress; NO `maybeArmContinuation`/`countProductiveBranchExit` on that
  hop). Calling the dispatcher's whole productive-exit block against `final` invents
  accounting the unarmed chain never did → different penalties/gates → different
  later trace recording → **non-byte-identical across modes.** Worse,
  `NativeResult.completed` is cumulative `rbx`, NOT `I`'s LOCAL count nor
  `ChainResult.completed`; feeding cumulative `rbx` to `onSideExit` can flip a
  low-yield event to "useful". Needs a WIDER result contract: final identity + final
  exit reason + final's **local** committed count + enclosing-chain progress — the
  current 4 `NativeResult` fields are insufficient.
- Minor: once linking is live, `traceById(id) orelse ct` (interp ~2595) should
  **fail closed** (assert), not silently reinterpret a child exit as the parent's.

Net: the first real arm needs (i) child linked-entry mode propagation, (ii) a wider
`NativeResult` (local completed + enclosing progress), (iii) a driveChain-faithful
accounting split (identity via `final`, steering-accounting replicates the hop's
logical events), (iv) fail-closed `traceById`. That's materially bigger than the
one-commit 2.3b in the plan.

**Bart's decision:** split into 2.3b-0 (inert scaffolding, reviewed) then 2.3b-1
(flip arming on + accounting split).

## 2.3b-0 — inert scaffolding: LANDED (byte-identical, awaiting peer review)

Four inert commits, each `just test` green + nsieve 3-mode byte-identical + tier-0
== `--jit-native` on the 6-benchmark differential. Nothing armed yet.
- **`9d16711`** — S3 prep: `prologue_fail` commits cumulative `rbx`, not literal 0.
  Byte-identical unchained (rbx provably 0); preserves progress once chained.
- **`963bdbb`** — fail-closed `traceById`: under `ran_native` assert the baked id
  resolves BEFORE `orelse ct` (kills the P-E dangling-link mask); keep `== ct`.
- **`319da11`** — `NativeResult.entry_rbx` snapshot (first body instr) → wrapper
  derives `ExecResult.local_completed = completed − entry_rbx`. Invariant
  `entry_rbx == 0` while unchained pins the mechanism; `local_completed` defaulted 0
  on tier-1a sites, read only on the native chained path (2.3b-1).
- **`954ea89`** — `linked_entry` stub (Trap-1 fix): every frameless body emits a
  secondary entry that presets `linked_loop_done=1` then falls through to
  `body_entry`; `CompiledTrace.linked_entry` = its abs addr (new
  `x64.Assembler.labelOffset`). Wiring invariant `arena ⟺ linked_entry`. Inert —
  nothing targets it until 2.3b-1.

## 2.3b-1 — flip `.link` arming ON: LANDED (byte-identical)

Two commits. **Step B (`66107a7`, committed):** dispatcher routes exit consumers
through `final = traceById(final_trace_id)` (strict on native — `@panic` on null,
release too; tier-1a still `ct`), productivity via `local_completed`.
**Step A (THIS commit):** `driveChain` actually arms + drains fused hops.

- **Arming** (`trace.zig`): after a hop is accounted, arm the continuation's
  `.link`-terminal slot → `inner.linked_entry` via `armNativeLink(current_link,
  len-1, inner, le)`. Eligibility: `tier == .native_only`, `safe_to_arm`,
  `inner.inputs.len == 0`, and the terminal (re-read AFTER the driver swap) is
  `.link` with `aux == inner_pc`. `safe_to_arm = suspend_ctl == null and
  !record_safepoint_lines`, computed in the dispatcher and threaded into
  `driveChain` (all 6 call sites). New counter `native_link_arms`.
- **Fused drain** (`trace.zig`): a `snt.run(current_link)` whose `final_trace_id !=
  current_link.id` fused straight into a child inner root. The drain resolves that
  child **STRICTLY** by `traceById(final_trace_id)` + `isInnerLoopRoot` shape check
  (never `findLoopTrace` substitution — a previously-armed slot can target a sibling
  `findLoopTrace` no longer picks). Loop-done vs. mid-loop is classified by
  `guardExitPc(child.instrs[exit_instr])` following a `for_loop`; steering uses the
  child's OWN `local_completed` (it inherits the parent's cumulative rbx). Same
  strict resolution seeds hop-0.
- **Hard-fail on identity break:** an unresolvable/mis-shaped fused id is a `@panic`,
  NOT a bail — the child's exit leaves `regs[]` with no known-coherent resume PC, so
  a `break`+resume could re-run a committed inner loop (silent double-count). Applies
  to hop-0 seed, the drain, and the dispatcher's native resolution.
- **Asserts dropped:** `assert(final == ct)` (interp.zig) and `assert(entry_rbx ==
  0)` (nativegen `runWithLinkedLoopDone`) — both false once fusion is live (a fused
  child inherits the parent's cumulative rbx and performs the final exit ≠ ct).

### Bug fixed during 2.3b-1 (under-count, native 2346810 vs 2406000)
A `guard_fits` array-guard mid-loop deopt on the fused inner's first trip
(`local_completed == 0`) was misclassified as loop-done, because `guardExitPc`
returns null for array guards and the drain's `fdone` defaulted null → `true`,
counting a phantom outer iteration and stranding iteration i=N. FIX: default the
null-`guardExitPc` and `exit_instr == maxInt` (prologue_fail) cases to `false`
(mid-loop → resume inner header, don't count).

### Peer review (codex gpt-5.6-sol, 3 rounds) — CLOSED
Round 1: 5 issues (prologue_fail maxInt phantom, fused-consumed-as-findLoopTrace,
pre-swap terminal validation, leftover `final==ct`, within-burst identity hole) —
all fixed. Round 2: demanded strict fail-closed identity resolution (no
substitution) — applied. Round 3: the fail-closed bails must `@panic` not `break`
(no safe resume PC), + strict native dispatcher resolution in release — applied.
Verdict: **no correctness blocker**; two doc nits (bail-comment wording, mirror the
9-completion bound into doc 17) — both addressed.

### Verification done for 2.3b-1
- `just test` green (EXIT=0; Debug asserts + link-counter tests).
- N-sweep 22/23/24/25/30/50/100/400: tier-0 == tier-1a == native byte-identical.
- Differential tier-0 == tier-1a == native OK on: nsieve, nbody, mandelbrot,
  fannkuch (spectralnorm.lua absent locally).

### Deferred out of 2.3b-1 (non-blocking, recorded in doc 17)
- **Issue 4:** native drain permits ≤ `visited.len + 1` (9) completions vs tier-1a's
  8 — a heuristic burst max, not a correctness contract; the "8-hop" comments should
  be reconciled to the 9-vs-8 split.
- **Issue 5 → P-F:** a slot stays armed and keeps fusing after `safe_to_arm` goes
  false; always correctly accounted, but widens the observation blackout window.
  Reset/decline-on-observation deferred to P-F.

NEXT: Increment 2.3c — arm ordinary source-branch guards + loop-done (S1 dual
materialization, S3 prologue-fail split, slot-identity collision decision).

## Unpushed local commits (Rule #15 — don't push unless asked)
master is well ahead of origin/master; do NOT push without Bart's say-so.

## Untracked files that belong to OTHER agents — do NOT stage
`CURRENT_TASK_E3.md`, `bench/results/*.tsv`, and similar.
